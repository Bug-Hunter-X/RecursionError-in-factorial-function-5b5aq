# RecursionError in Factorial Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions in Python: exceeding the maximum recursion depth.
The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a simple recursive factorial function. This function works fine for small inputs, but when called with a large number, it results in a `RecursionError`.
The solution in `factorial_solution.py` shows how to mitigate this using iteration.
